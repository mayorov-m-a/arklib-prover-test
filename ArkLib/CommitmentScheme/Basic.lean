  # Commitment Schemes with Oracle Openings

  A commitment scheme, relative to an oracle `oSpec : OracleSpec ι`, and for a given function
  `oracle : Data → Query → Response` transforming underlying data `Data` into an oracle `Query →
  Response`, is a tuple of two operations:

  - Commit, which is a function `commit : Data → Randomness → OracleComp oSpec Commitment`
  - Open, which is (roughly) an interactive proof (relative to `oSpec`) for the following relation:
    - `StmtIn := (cm : Commitment) × (x : Query) × (y : Response)`
    - `WitIn := (d : Data) × (r : Randomness)`
    - `rel : StmtIn → WitIn → Prop := fun ⟨cm, x, y⟩ ⟨d, r⟩ => commit d r = cm ∧ oracle d x = y`

  There is one inaccuracy about the relation above: `commit` is an oracle computation, and not a
  deterministic function; hence the relation is not literally true as described. This is why
  security definitions for commitment schemes have to be stated differently than those for IOPs.
